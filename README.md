# Overview

The team you are applying for is laser-focused on writing new code.   You'll get a spec, write the code, and write the tests. That's it. No diagramming, no writing documentation, no scrum meetings. Our team is dedicated to test-driven development so our code writing includes unit, integration, and mutation tests to meet our no-nonsense expectations for code quality.  To be successful on our team you must be an expert programmer in at least one of our 4 main languages with the desire and ability to add languages and technologies to your tool set.

Our most successful team members have the ability to receive a spec, research any new technologies required and return code that delivers exactly what is written.  They are capable of quickly integrating and debugging new technologies so that we can ensure simplicity in our code, avoiding inconsistencies or redundancies.

This is your chance to demonstrate more of your development skills and your ability to learn quickly.  Research any technology you are less familiar with to deliver a complete solution and show us your commitment to high quality, maintainable code complete with unit and integration test code.
